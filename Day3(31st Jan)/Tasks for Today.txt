
Task 1(a)

		Difference between TUPLE and DICTIONARY


TupleDictionarySeveral elements are joined togetherStores records in Key-value pair.It stores record in order sequenceDoes not store record in sequence Values cannot be changedValues can be changed


Task1(b)
Create a dictionary
[
	person{
		“firstName” : “JK”
		“lastName” : “Patel”
		“age” : 50
		“address” : {
			“street” : “265 york land blvd”
			“area” : “NorthYork”
			“postalCode” : “M1H1Y1”
	}	
		“total amount” : 2000
}


]


Solution: -

var Address = [String: AnyObject]()
Address["Street"] = "265 Yorkland Blvd" as! AnyObject
Address["Area"] = "North York" as AnyObject
Address["Postal Code"] = "M1H1Y1" as AnyObject

var person = [String:AnyObject]()
person["FirstName"] = "JK" as AnyObject
person["LastName"] = "Patel" as AnyObject
person["Age"]   = 50 as AnyObject
person["Address"] = Address as AnyObject
person["Total Amount"] = 200 as AnyObject

print("Person",person)


Task1(c)

	Create a function which can find a factorial of given number

func factorial(num: Int) -> (Int)
{
    if num == 1
    {
        return 1
    }else{
       return num * factorial(num: num - 1) 

        
    }
}

factorial(num:3)
